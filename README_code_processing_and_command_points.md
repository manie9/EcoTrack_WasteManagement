## 1st step 

 After thinking about a problem and challenges, This was my first promt message on GPT-4o mini


I am looking at building a tech solution to solve a prevailing problem on human waste pollution in an environment 

PROBLEM: There is a problem of indiscriminate waste dump in an environment, which is causing environmental pollution and health hazzard, how do I solve this issue in order to prevent a disease outbreak in the community and country, using technology solution? 
 

CHALLENGE: The mission is, build human-centered, AI enabled tech solutions that solve this real challenge, on getting the relevant authorities to pick up waste intime, residence education and awareness on dangers of indiscriminate refuse dump, (waste mangement ) (separation of waste) and (recycling)

## 2nd step 

After which I got a response I read through and sent my second promo message which is

(Can you summarise this response into a prompt for Mobile/Web Ai code solution )

## 3rd step 

Then my 3rd promt adding to my 2nd promt

Also add this few request to the promt 
Aesthetic Appeal; Clean and cohesive UI/UX, “Wow” moments that delight users with beautiful visual appealing interface,  Technical Creativity: Unique tool use or creative coding hacks, Clever, constraint-bending innovation
Security & Fault Tolerance: Data protection, error handling, and app reliability

__________

## After I got the result and tested it, there were Few problems I encountered, and asked I created this prompt below to report the issue 

## 1:

 In the Upcoming events section, The join and register button isn’t functioning, 

## 2: 

Check the AI Waste Sorting Assistant section, the analyse with Ai section should be more accurate in its analysis with the sorting results and disposal instructions. The Mark as sorted & ( Get more info ) button isn’t functional 

The Export Report should be functional 

## 3: 
Recycling Guide
Learn proper waste separation techniques
Learn More
Environmental Impact
Understand the dangers of improper dumping
Explore

No page detected when user click Learn More & Explore Button, add pages that users can read for educational purposes and information 

## 4: 

This should be a demo app where users can input data and get adequate information and response, without any pre written data that wasn’t inputed by any user. 

## 5: 

Check all sections where data should be inputed or displayed & make sure whatever data is being displayed is by a user operating this app. 

## 6: 

The notification icon should also be functional, users should click on it and see what notification is available, current points should also reflect current input 

## 7: 

After resolving the mobile app issues, create a separate web app for this

## 8: 

create a toggle button for dark mode and a confetti to celebrate anyone who reports waste issues

## 9: 

issue detected, there should be no black background when its not on darkmode, another suggestion, black backgrounds should be replaced with a more beautiful visual appealing colour or aztec pattern if possible when its not in dark mode,  after this issue has been resolved, Create a README for this app

-- Ater this Promt-- 

A dark mode and confetti celebration was created, but while testing, the dashboard maintained a dark background which didn’t look too pleasant, i had to removed it & Because of time constraints, and limited prompt message I had to go back to previous version which is in the README file, without a dark mode or confetti to celebrate report, be that as it may extra  features can still be updated in upcoming app version,
